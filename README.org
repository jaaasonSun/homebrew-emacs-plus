[[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs+]] is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][GNU Emacs]] formulae for macOS [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]] package manager. This fork exists solely to apply additional patches on top of upstream formula for personal use, including

- alpha-background support, from [[https://github.com/bbenchen/homebrew-emacs-plus][bbenchen/homebrew-emacs-plus]]
- translucent (blurred) frame background
- preserving traffic light while hide title bar (=--with-no-titlebar=)
- a new Emacs icon (=--with-unknown-big-sur-circle-icon=) that I randomly found years ago from unknown source (likely on [[https://macosicons.com/][macOSicons]]), shown on the right. Please reach out if you know who made this icon.

Please refer to upstream repo for more information.
